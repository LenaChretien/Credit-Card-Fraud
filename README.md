# Credit-Card-Fraud

This is a EDA approach to detecting Credit Card Fraud in financial data. The most popular approach is the use of Machine Learning. However, the first part of this project will focus on using a EDA approach to explore possible signs of fraud. 

The Dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/mishra5001/credit-card/

While the data set is called credit card fraud, the data is acually data on default on (mainly) cash loans. 
It is comprised of two data sets, a current credit holder data set and a previous application data set. There are about 222,000 clients that currently hold a credit, that also have past applications. This subset is used here. 

The analysis focuses on a small amount of variables (for now), gender, age, income, credit amount, education, previous application outcome. 
The exploratory data analysis into credit default rates, which brings to light three characteristic clients: A current credit holder, (married female, 30-45 years old, with secondary education and a credit amount of 0.5 - 1 million), a applicant that is most likely to be rejected (a person, male or female, below 30, with a higher education degree, and an income in the upper classes, asking for more than 1 million dollers), as well as a credit holder that is most likely to default on their credit (a male below 30, with an income in the middle class and a lower secondary education, that has a credit amount of $300,000 - $500,000). This shows that most rejections are not in line with the profile of the person that is most likely to default on their credit.
